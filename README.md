# DictionaryAssistant
>A simple WinForms program that displays various statistics and information for dictionary wordlists.


This program is an implementation of _**Business_Requirements.pdf**_ as a Windows Forms Application.

I developed this program using TDD, Test-Driven Development.

After porting the logic of this program into [this project](https://github.com/m-flak/DictionaryAssistantMVC), I brought back the class library and updated this project to use it instead.
